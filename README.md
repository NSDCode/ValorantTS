# ValorantTS


## What's that ? ü§î
ValorantTS is the easiest way to use true stretched resolution on VALORANT

## What is true stretched ‚ùì
By default, VALORANT disables the ability to play in a stretch resolution like in Counter-Strike, they only stretch the HUD (which is useless except for the crosshair)
true-stretched resolution is everything stretched.

## How to ? üò•
After you downloaded the binaries, open ``user.json``, inside replace ``Resolution`` by the stretched resolution you want to have and ``DefaultResolution`` by your monitor default resolution (e.g: 1920x1080)

**Userid**: Press Windows Key + R type 'AppData' and click OK, go to ``Local\VALORANT\Saved\Config\`` and then you should find a folder looking like this ``x9cfyg4c-a8a1-5ag7-e956-2e96bvb7gxcp-na`` here is your userid.

Start the program and enjoy !


NOTE: When the game is fully started, the program will ask you to press enter. Make sure that your video settings are set to `Windowed` and `Fill` before pressing enter. You may experience black bars if it is not on `Fill`. When you restart the game, the game may be revert the settings, so make sure to check this setting each time. the resolution should not matter

## How does it work ? ‚öô

First, the program change your game's config to match your default res and settings to use true-stretched (it also prevents VALORANT from changing your settings back).
Once this is done, the program will change WS_BORDER to remove them, and then set the game to Maximized.
The resolution is changed using QRes.

If you're having issues where the resolution is not centered / too stretched, make sure you put back windowed mode at your default res every time you launch Valorant

NOTE: every time you ALT+TAB, your resolution will be changed automatically to your default res and will be changed back to stretch one back in game.

## Is it safe ? üîí
Some people claimed that they got banend using true stretched, however i don't think these ellegations are true: The technique used to make true stretched working does not interract with the game directly (game memory). The only thing that could be debatable is modifying ``WS_BORDER`` and even this, i don't think this should cause any issue since it's a windows property that every application has and not part of the VALORANT game itself.

# ValorantTS


## What's that ? ü§î
ValorantTS is the easiest way to use true stretched resolution on VALORANT

## What is true stretched ? ‚ùì
By default, VALORANT disables the ability to play in a stretch resolution like in Counter-Strike, they only stretch the HUD (which is useless except for the crosshair)
true-stretched resolution is everything stretched.

## How does it work ? ‚öô

First, the program change your game's config to match your default res and settings to use true-stretched (it also prevents VALORANT from changing your settings back).
Once this is done, the program will change WS_BORDER to remove them, and then set the game to Maximized.
The resolution is changed using QRes

## Is it safe ? üîí

The method used is the same as using NVIDIA Control Panel and winexplorer, i don't think it's bannable but USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
